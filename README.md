### Song Starter Express Server

## Introduction

Hate starting new songs? Get started!
Starting a new song can be hard. Your lyrics feel uninspired. You keep falling into the same chord progressions. It's too hard to be original. Let the app do the work for you.

This repository is for the Back End database, to visit the repository for the Front End application click [here](https://github.com/DrewBradley/song-starter).
The backend has not been deployed yet, but will be soon!

## Features

- CURRENTLY: Songs can be saved and retrieved at a later date, thanks to local storage.
- When a user creates a song on their account, it is saved to the database that corresponds with their username.

## Deployed

- Users login in using Google/Facebook credentials.
- Users can save songs that can be accessed on other devices.
- FE Application can be converted to PWA.
